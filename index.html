You might even ask whether or not you can actually <em>do</em> anything with just these two languages! The good news is that there are many types of projects out there that beginners can use to practice coding, build skills, study, and <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/earn-more-money-freelancing-for-beginners/" class="main_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even start earning money</a>.
